# UK Energy Forecasting (2005–2030)

This project was completed as part of my MSc Data Science dissertation at the University of Salford.  
It analyses historical energy consumption trends across UK regions and forecasts demand to 2030.

## 🔑 Tools & Methods
- **SQL Server** → data preprocessing, handling missing values, exploratory queries  
- **Power BI** → dashboards with KPIs, fuel breakdowns, and interactive slicers  
- **Python (Google Colab)** → ARIMA & ETS forecasting models (2021–2030)  
- **R** → statistical validation for forecasting models  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: UK Government Energy Statistics (2005–2020)  
- **Variables**: Year, Fuel type, Region, Energy consumption (ktoe)  

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- Sharp decline in coal usage, steady growth in renewables  
- London and major cities are highest energy consumers  
- Forecasts show renewables rising steadily, with moderate growth in total consumption

## 📈 Results & Impact
- Delivered **end-to-end pipeline**: SQL → Power BI → Python  
- Built forecasting models with ARIMA & ETS (evaluated using MAE, RMSE, MAPE)  
- Produced **actionable insights** for policymakers and urban planners
